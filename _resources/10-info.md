Thanks for stopping by.

**Onym** is a [Greg Leppert](http://leppert.me/) and [Willem Van
Lancker](http://willemvanlancker.com) joint production. The name comes from the suffix *-onym* used to denote specific types of names — from the Greek word *ónoma* meaning "name." 

It was designed and built in Cambridge, MA and Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY. The
site is (appropriately) set in [Untitled

**[Gregory Leppert](http://leppert.me/)** is named for his father who, in
turn, was named for Gregory the Great, the sixth century Pope known
for establishing papal supremacy. His middle name goes without mention
– one of those musky old family names that inevitably leads the
listener to ask for its spelling and question his parents’ naming
judgment. His surname, Leppert, hails from the Alsace region by way of
Bavaria. It stems from "Liutberht," an Old German word meaning the
“bright” (-berht) or holy “people” (liut-).

**[Willem Paul Van Lancker](http://willemvanlancker.com)** is named
for Dutch-American abstract expressionist artist Willem De
Kooning. His middle name comes from his maternal grandfather, Paul
Emile Poirier, who was an arborist. His surname, Van Lancker, is
Belgian and while its meaning is unclear, the prefix "Van" is a
preposition meaning "of" or "from" and is traditionally capitalized in
Belgian names. The surname commonly refers to a house (common or
noble) or signifies ancestral relation to a particular place.

- [Artsy & Syria](https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/04/confirmed-art-sy-has-permanently-moved-to-artsy-net-due-to-ongoing-syrian-unrest/)

  Shortly after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, The United
  States set sanctions against Syria, which included .sy domains,
  forcing then Art.sy to become Artsy and start using Artsy.net as
  their primary domain.

  .ly domains were poorly managed due to political instability

- [Bodega](https://blog.bodega.ai/so-about-our-name-aa5bff63a92d)

  Two ex-Googlers start a "don't call it a vending machine" company
  named Bodega. To add insult to injury the company's logo is a bodega
  cat. New Yorkers and the rest of the internet revolt ---
  highlighting the insensitivity, cultural ignorance, and hubris of
  the name.

- -[ify](http://www.thenameinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/ify-names-chart-20141.pdf)

  One of the bigger trendings of naming in the late 00’s and early
  10’s — largely attributed to Spotify’s success and arrival to the US
  in 2011.

- [iPhone X](https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/x_man)

  Apple confuses customers and chooses to name their newest flagship
  phone the iPhone X, insisting it should be pronounced iPhone 10 ---
  muddling Apple's sequential iPhone numbering and bringing back Roman
  numerals in a big way.

- [Paper](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/03/a-tale-of-two-papers-facebook-fiftythree/)

  - A common word and popular name for tech company products focused
    on productivity and writing. A bit of an obvious name given the
    screen's role as a replacement for paper products (notebooks,
    journals, sketchbooks, calendars, etc). In 2014 FiftyThree made a
    public statement and filed a copyright lawsuit against Facebook
    after Facebook's launch of "Paper"  — it went nowhere.
